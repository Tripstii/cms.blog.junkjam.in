Our number 10 celebrity is our favourite dhumkas girl. This superstar, super model and modern Entrepreneur that each girl want to be like has lot s more to stay herself practical to keep out of her laughing list.

As confessed by this beautiful diva herself, Shetty always wear “TWO” watches during cricket matches of IPL.  It is NOT all, the way she cross her legs when oppositions team bats is ACTUALLY insane.

Shilpa we love you and millions of your fans don’t want you to have such senseless fear or FAITH.

Always on the news for her fitness and over sensuous body, now this bollywood queen caught in our list with her over senseless thinking on the FEAR or faith over devil in particular. This Bengali sexy diva is always seen in horror movie but our reader will be chuckle after knowing her INSANE flicks for keeping lemon and green chillies in car every Saturday to keep her safe from evil eye.

Well bips, fearing from BHOOOOOOOT is not a cool idea.

Our bollywood Barbie doll is always in the mind for her sexy face and controversial love relationships. But this time she is stuck with our list for her superstitious belief of dargah of Sufi saint Khwaja Moinuddin Chisti in Ajmer before of movie release date. 

Devotion is good kat but making it little pernickety and obligatory each time surely make you look insane.

#7 Deepika Padukone

After Katrina, Deepika is our next number to have insensible faith that sure said to be insane.  Going with the flow as Kat, she visits Siddhivinayak Temple in Prabhadevi.
Well visiting temple is NOT weird, but making it OBLIGATERY is INSANE. 

#6 Ajay Devgn

oOops Aamir is  ACTUALLY a heart breaking name to see in this list for sure. Having famous to be called as Mr. Perfectionist in Bollywood industry and looked up by millions of young minds, this INSANE thing is NOT so cool.
