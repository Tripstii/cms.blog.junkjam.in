Skydiving is a sport in which participants jump or fall from aircraft at altitude. They can perform an assortment of aerial manoeuvres before deploying a parachute to slow their descent, allowing them to come gently to rest on the Earth below. The sport is also known as parachuting, in a reference to that vital piece of safety equipment. People at different levels of physical fitness can participate in skydiving, as long as they are ready for an adrenalin-packed sport which can be both terrifying and exhilarating.


# Types of Sky Dives

## 1. Tandem Jump

The simplest form of skydiving in India, here you are connected to an instructor via a harness. Both of you jump together using the same parachute and the instructor pulls the cord.

Note: You need only minimal instruction before this jump.

## 2. Static Line Jump

In this skydive you are connected with a cord to the aircraft. And the parachute opens automatically after around 3 seconds of freefall with no action required by the passenger.

Note: The jump is made from only 3000 feet and requires upto 6 hours of training.

## 3. Accelerated Free Fall
