Well, your footwear is a mirror of your style sense. So, I suggest pair your outfit and jewelry with nice traditional footwear like kolhapuri chapples,
jodhpuri or mojadi. You can also go with nice pair of flipflops with designs and glittery stones. 

#Get trendy with long skirts:

Do you have collection of ethnic tops and jackets? Then team up those with any vibrant colored long skirt. But make sure not to go with 
very flowy or dramatic skirts as it can mess with diyas or rangoli. 

#Stylish nose ring:

Though it’s very less considered armament in jewelry, Stylish nose ring can gives you elegant look for this Diwali. You can find various kinds of nose ring or studs with different material like metal, 
stone, gold etc. 

So, these are some fashion trends that can surely help you to make right choice for yourself to rock this Diwali festival. Enjoy your Diwali to the fullest!!!
